# STM32F103 'Blue Pill' Programming Board
STM32F103 Programming Helper PCB from PCBWay

Programming the STM32F103C8T6 is easy using an FTDI USB-to-Serial dongle. Plug one end into your PCs USB socket and connect two wires to the STM32 (plus power). 

All good. 

Until the wires come off and you spend ages plugging it back in (wrongly). This PCB does away with all the hassle and lets you program an STM32 in seconds.

So I was frustrated as not getting the USB socket working as expected on my "Blue Pill" STM32 board and reverted to an equally good way of connecting it to my PC with an FTDI dongle.

But it needed a better and more secure way of connecting the two devices so I designed a PCB from PCBWay to help me. Whilst I was at it I included a couple of LEDs and a switch to obviate the need of the jumpers. Oh, and big, red RESET switch!

"Beginning STM32" book. I've got this excellent technical book and it's bare metal programming using freeRTOS, libopencm3 and GCC. I'm slowly working my way through it. Not for the faint-hearted but it is absolutely superb, the bees knees!
